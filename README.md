# Economic Analysis
This repository contains a series of economic analyses performed on the backbone of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) technology. The goal is to improve my data analysis skills while at the same time furthering my knowledge of economics, finance and Python.
